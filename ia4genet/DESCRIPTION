Description: The study of genetic variation among human individuals
  engenders substantial archives of details on individual genomes.
  Details of genetic variation are interpreted using evolving
  resources that are assembled at various scales,
  institutionally and privately.  NCBI's dbSNP assembles
  information on relatively small variants that occur with
  some regularity in human populations.  The EMBL-EBI GWAS catalog
  provides a curated view of replicated studies of genotype-phenotype
  association.  This workflow reviews the use of Bioconductor packages
  that help investigators interpret their own findings in studies
  of human genetics.
