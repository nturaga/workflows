Description: The workflow illustrates  use of the flow cytometry packages to 
    load, transform and visualize the flow data and gate certain populations 
    in the dataset. The workflow loads the `flowCore`, `flowStats` and `flowViz`
    packages and its dependencies.  It loads the ITN data with 15 samples, each 
    of which includes, in addition to FSC and SSC, 5 fluorescence channels: CD3,
    CD4, CD8, CD69 and HLADR. 
Depends: R (>= 3.3.0),
         flowCore,
         flowStats,
         flowViz
