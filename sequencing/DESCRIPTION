Description: Bioconductor enables the analysis and comprehension of high-
    throughput genomic data. We have a vast number of packages that allow
    rigorous statistical analysis of large data while keeping
    technological artifacts in mind. Bioconductor helps users place their
    analytic results into biological context, with rich opportunities for
    visualization. Reproducibility is an important goal in Bioconductor
    analyses. Different types of analysis can be carried out using Bioconductor,
    for example; Sequencing : RNASeq, ChIPSeq, variants, copy number etc.; 
    Microarrays: expression, SNP, etc.; Domain specific analysis : Flow cytometry,
    Proteomics etc. For these analyses, one typically imports and works with 
    diverse sequence-related file types, including fasta, fastq, BAM, gtf, 
    bed, and wig files, among others. Bioconductor packages support import, 
    common and advanced sequence manipulation operations such as trimming, 
    transformation, and alignment including quality assessment.
